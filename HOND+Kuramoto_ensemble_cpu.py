        HOND-Kuramoto Model: Synchronization Variability Analysis Framework
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository provides a Python implementation of a **Harmonic Oscillator Network Embedding (HONE)** 
model coupled with a **damped Kuramoto model**. The framework analyzes synchronization 
variability using a multi-layer ensemble approach.

ðŸ“Œ **Key Features:**
- **Laplacian-based synchronization analysis** to quantify global coherence.
- **Node-based and phase-based variability** to measure local synchronization stability.
- **Parallelized simulations** using multi-threading for efficient computation.
- **Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC)** applied for accurate phase modeling.
- **Velocity and phase synchronization metrics** computed across multiple realizations.

ðŸ“Œ **Applications:**
- Network synchronization analysis in biological, social, and engineered systems.
- Evaluating stability in multi-agent systems and coupled oscillators.
- Investigating phase-locking phenomena in large-scale networks.
